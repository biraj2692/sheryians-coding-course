Project Exercise 5: Style Your Form!
Description:

Make your form look good with CSS! Add colors, rounded corners, and make it
interactive. Learn to style different parts of the form when someone uses it (like when
they hover or click).


Hints: Pseudo-classes (:hover, :focus, :active):

Hint: Change how things look when you point at them (hover), click in them (focus), or
click on them (active). Think about button colors or input field borders.


CSS Transitions:

Hint: Make style changes smooth, not instant. Use transition to control how styles
change over time.

Transforms (2D):

Hint: Move, rotate, or scale things! Try making your button slightly bigger or move a bit
when you hover using transform.

Transforms (3D - Challenge):

Hint: Make things look like they have depth. This is harder! Look at perspective and
rotateX to make elements tilt. (Optional!)

CSS Animation (Challenge):

Hint: Make things move on their own! Use @keyframes to create simple moving
effects, like a pulsing button. (Optional!)
